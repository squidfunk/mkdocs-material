However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the live preview server and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you should see them almost instantly after saving. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir key: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git .

For example. to replace the original footer.html , create a footer.html file in the overrides/partials directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a block, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the Disqus integration extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation . Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like TypeScript and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 12 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the Webpack watchdog with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overridden when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in the original mkdocs.yml .

Material for MkDocs Insiders strives to be compatible with Material for MkDocs, so all new features are implemented as feature flags and all improvements (e.g. search) do not require any changes to existing configuration. This means that your users will be able to build the docs locally with the regular version and when they push their changes to CI/CD, they will be built with Material for MkDocs Insiders. For this reason, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Material for MkDocs Insiders under the same terms? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code from Material for MkDocs Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would cannibalize the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Material for MkDocs Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like .

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material for MkDocs with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px . To learn more about the problem and implications, please refer to #911 in which the problem was discovered and fixed. Changes to mkdocs.yml \u00b6 None.

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 Admonition \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Admonition extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, is integrated with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Details \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Details extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , adds the ability to make admonitions collapsible . It can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.details SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code and content blocks inside admonitions , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Usage \u00b6 Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block must start with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier. Example : !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks . Example : !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content \u00b6 Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks. While the parser from the standard Markdown library doesn't account for nested blocks, the SuperFences extension adds the ability to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. ``` python def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 The Details extension adds support for rendering collapsible admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks, but must start with ??? . Example : ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after ??? will render the block as open on page load: Example : ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers later in this document, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, all of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a table, inline and pymdownx.inline render line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx.inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of table or pymdownx.inline is recommended. Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but can also yield weird results. Use them at your own risk. InlineHilite \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions also integrates with Material for MkDocs and adds support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks . It's built on top of the Highlight extension and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.inlinehilite See the section on inline code blocks for usage information. Keys \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for inserting keyboard keys , e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del , and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.keys SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code blocks inside other blocks , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Snippets \u00b6 The Snippets extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows to insert content from other files or other, regular content, and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.snippets Usage \u00b6 This section discusses how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments \u2013 the default highlighter \u2013 so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Specifying the language \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add code highlighting to those blocks, add the language short name directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the short name for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the short name, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows splitting large code blocks for readability. Example : ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language short name. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums . Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code blocks \u00b6 When InlineHilite is enabled, inline code blocks can be highlighted by prefixing them with a shebang-like sequence, i.e. #! , directly followed by the language short name . Example : The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Result : The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Adding keyboard keys \u00b6 When Keys is enabled, keyboard keys can be rendered with a simple syntax. Consult the Python Markdown Extensions documentation to learn about all available key codes. Example : ++ctrl+alt+del++ Result : Ctrl + Alt + Del Embedding external files \u00b6 Also known as transcludes or file transclusion in MultiMarkdown . When Snippets is enabled, content from other files can be embedded, which is especially useful to reference and embed the contents of source files directly into your project documentation. Example : ``` --8<--\u200b \".browserslistrc\" ``` Result : last 4 years Note that Snippets is not limited to code blocks, but can be used anywhere from a document to move repeating content to separate files, which is also explained in the official documentation . Customization \u00b6 Custom syntax theme \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy If Pygments is used, Material for MkDocs provides the styles for code blocks , which are built with a custom and well-balanced palette that works equally well for both color schemes : --md-code-hl-number-color --md-code-hl-special-color --md-code-hl-function-color --md-code-hl-constant-color --md-code-hl-keyword-color --md-code-hl-string-color --md-code-hl-name-color --md-code-hl-operator-color --md-code-hl-punctuation-color --md-code-hl-comment-color --md-code-hl-generic-color --md-code-hl-variable-color Code block foreground, background and line highlight colors are defined via: --md-code-fg-color --md-code-bg-color --md-code-hl-color Let's say you want to change the color of \"strings\" . While there are several types of string tokens , Material for MkDocs assigns a single color to most of them. Create an additional stylesheet , and add: : root > * { -- md-code-hl-string-color : #0FF1CE ; } If you want to tweak a specific type of string, i.e. `backticks` , you can lookup the specific class name in the syntax theme definition , and override it as part of your additional stylesheet: . highlight . sb { color : #0FF1CE ; }","title":"Code blocks"},{"location":"reference/code-blocks/#code-blocks","text":"Code blocks and examples are an essential part of technical project documentation.

Usage \u00b6 Setting the page title \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page title can be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet --- This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Note that the site title is appended using a dash as a separator, which is the default behavior. Setting the page description \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page description can also be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. --- This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Adding a web app manifest \u00b6 A web app manifest is a simple JSON file that specifies how your web application should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop, which can be set via mkdocs.yml : extra : manifest : manifest.webmanifest Customization \u00b6 Custom meta tags \u00b6 In order to add meta tags to your document, you can extend the theme and simply override the extrahead block with the respective tags, e.g. to set policies for search engines: {% block extrahead %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"noindex, nofollow\" /> {% endblock %} Some further examples, including Open Graph and Twitter Cards : Open Graph {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title | striptags %} {% endif %} < meta property = \"og:type\" content = \"website\" /> < meta property = \"og:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:url\" content = \"{{ page.canonical_url }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:type\" content = \"image/png\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:width\" content = \"1200\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:height\" content = \"630\" /> {% endblock %} Twitter Cards {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title | striptags %} {% endif %} < meta name = \"twitter:card\" content = \"summary_large_image\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:site\" content = \"<username>\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:creator\" content = \"<username>\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> {% endblock %}","title":"Meta tags"},{"location":"reference/meta-tags/#meta-tags","text":"In HTML, meta tags allow to provide additional metadata for a document, e.g. page titles and descriptions, additional assets to be loaded, and Open Graph data.

Customization \u00b6 Custom colors \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs implements colors using CSS variables (custom properties). If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand-specific colors), you can add an additional stylesheet and tweak the values of the CSS variables. Let's say you're YouTube , and want to set the primary color to your brand's palette. Just add: : root { -- md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; -- md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; -- md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } See the file containing the color definitions for a list of all CSS variables. Custom color schemes \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Besides overriding specific colors, you can create your own, named color scheme by wrapping the definitions in the [ data-md-color-scheme = \"...\" ] attribute selector , which you can then set via mkdocs.yml as described in the color schemes section: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"youtube\" ] { -- md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; -- md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; -- md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } Additionally, the slate color scheme defines all of it's colors via hsla color functions and deduces its colors from the --md-hue CSS variable. You can tune the slate theme with: [ data-md-color-scheme = \"slate\" ] { -- md-hue : 210 ; /* [0, 360] */ }","title":"Changing the colors"},{"location":"setup/changing-the-colors/#changing-the-colors","text":"As any proper Material Design implementation, Material for MkDocs supports Google's original color palette , which can be easily configured through mkdocs.yml .

If you want more fine-grained control, i.e. collapsible subsections for the first tab , you can use top-level sections , so that the top-level is entirely made up of sections.

The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: app . keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners.","title":"Setting up navigation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-navigation/#setting-up-navigation","text":"A clear and concise navigation structure is an important aspect of good project documentation.

This is illustrated in the following example: Top-level pages nav : - Tab 1 + Page 1.1 - Page 1.2 - Tab 2 : - Page 2.1 - Page 2.2 - Page 2.3 - Page 1.3 Top-level sections nav : - Tab 1 : - Page 1.1 - Page 1.2 - Page 1.3 - Tab 2 : - Page 2.1 - Page 2.2 - Page 2.3 Note that tabs are only shown for larger screens, so make sure that navigation is plausible on mobile devices.

Configuration \u00b6 Versioning \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Utility \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only mike makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of your project documentation. It integrates natively with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : extra : version : method : mike This will render a version selector in the header next to the title of your project: Try this feature This feature is enabled in the versioning example built with Insiders. Why use mike? mike is built around the idea that once you've generated your docs for a particular version, you should never need to touch that version again. This means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in your gh-pages branch. While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a <major>.<minor> directory, with optional aliases (e.g. latest or dev ) to particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever version of the documentation you want to direct people to. Note that you don't need to run mike install-extras as noted in the official documentation , as mike is now natively integrated with Material for MkDocs. Usage \u00b6 While this section outlines the basic workflow for publishing new versions, it's best to check out the official documentation to make yourself familar with mike . Publishing a new version \u00b6 If you want to publish a new version of your project documentation, choose a version identifier and update the alias set as the default version with: mike deploy --push --update-aliases 0.1 latest Note that every version will be deployed as a subdirectory of your site_url , e.g.: docs.example.com/0.1 docs.example.com/0.2 ... Setting a default version \u00b6 When starting with mike , a good idea is to set an alias as a default version, e.g. latest , and when publishing a new version, always update the alias to point to the latest version: mike set-default --push latest When publishing a new version, mike will create a redirect in the root of your project documentation to the version associated with the alias: docs.example.com docs.example.com/0.1","title":"Setting up versioning"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#setting-up-versioning","text":"Material for MkDocs makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of your project documentation by integrating with external utilities that add those capabilities to MkDocs, i.e. mike .

It integrates natively with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : extra : version : method : mike This will render a version selector in the header next to the title of your project: Try this feature This feature is enabled in the versioning example built with Insiders. Why use mike? mike is built around the idea that once you've generated your docs for a particular version, you should never need to touch that version again. This means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in your gh-pages branch. While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a <major>.<minor> directory, with optional aliases (e.g. latest or dev ) to particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever version of the documentation you want to direct people to. Note that you don't need to run mike install-extras as noted in the official documentation , as mike is now natively integrated with Material for MkDocs.","title":"Versioning"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#usage","text":"While this section outlines the basic workflow for publishing new versions, it's best to check out the official documentation to make yourself familar with mike .","title":"Usage"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#publishing-a-new-version","text":"If you want to publish a new version of your project documentation, choose a version identifier and update the alias set as the default version with: mike deploy --push --update-aliases 0.1 latest Note that every version will be deployed as a subdirectory of your site_url , e.g.: docs.example.com/0.1 docs.example.com/0.2 ...","title":"Publishing a new version"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-versioning/#setting-a-default-version","text":"When starting with mike , a good idea is to set an alias as a default version, e.g. latest , and when publishing a new version, always update the alias to point to the latest version: mike set-default --push latest When publishing a new version, mike will create a redirect in the root of your project documentation to the version associated with the alias: docs.example.com docs.example.com/0.1","title":"Setting a default version"}]}
