Is this still possible?</p> <p>Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features are implemented behind feature flags; almost all configuration changes are  backward-compatible. This means that developers will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions).</p> <p>When using built-in plugins that are solely available via Insiders, it might be  necessary to split the <code>mkdocs.yml</code> configuration into a base configuration, and one with plugin overrides. Note that this is a limitation of MkDocs, which can be mitigated by using configuration inheritance.</p> <p>See the getting started guide for more information.</p>","title":"Compatibility"},{"location":"insiders/#payment","text":"<p>We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options?</p> <p>Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle. If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that).</p> <p>If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com.</p>","title":"Payment"},{"location":"insiders/#terms","text":"<p>Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as Material for MkDocs?</p> <p>Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license. However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use   it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it,   but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the    sponsorware strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a   collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you   may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like.   Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks.</p> </li> </ul>   <ol> <li> <p>In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com, stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li>

This should help you identify pages that need to be improved:</p> <p></p>  <p>The following properties must be set for each rating:</p>  <code>icon</code>  <p> Default: none \u00b7  Required \u2013 This property must point to a valid icon path referencing any icon bundled with the theme, or the build will not succeed.

It may contain arbitrary HTML tags, which is especially useful to ask the user to provide more detailed feedback for the current page through a form. It's also possible to pre-fill forms with the URL and title of the current page by using the following placeholders:</p> <ul> <li><code>{url}</code> \u2013 Page URL</li> <li><code>{title}</code> \u2013 Page title</li> </ul> <pre><code>https://github.com/.../issues/new/?title=[Feedback]+{title}+-+{url}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, when clicking the link, the user is redirected to the \"new  issue\" form of your repository, with a pre-filled title including the path of the current document, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>[Feedback] Setting up site analytics \u2013 /setup/setting-up-site-analytics/\n</code></pre> <p>An alternative to GitHub issues is Google Forms.</p>","title":"Was this page helpful?"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-analytics/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-analytics/#hiding-the-feedback-widget","text":"<p>When Metadata is enabled, the feedback widget can be hidden for a document with custom front matter.
