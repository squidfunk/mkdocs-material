Want to report a bug? Before you do, please read the following guidelines. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us on gitter.im . Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our GitHub repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines . Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as the Material for MkDocs is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is: For a major feature , first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master , as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the project. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Fork the project, set up the development environment , make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Build : Before submitting a pull requests, build the theme . This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the theme should at all times be installable through GitHub. Pull Request : After building the theme, commit the compiled output, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to mkdocs-material:master . If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Interested in contributing to the Material for MkDocs?

However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server supports live reloading. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you reference using custom_dir : theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory. The directory layout of the theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # 3rd-party integrations \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 hero.html # Hero teaser \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-date.html # Last updated date \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-link.html # Link to source file \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the overrides directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the overrides directory and define the block, e.g.: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title> {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the Announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like TypeScript and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 12 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the Webpack watchdog with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overridden when the theme is built. Build process \u00b6 When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original theme.","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#a-great-starting-point","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a good starting point for making it look great.

Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately. Installation in a virtual environment The best way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a virtual environment . Don't know what this is or how to set it up? We recommend to start by reading a tutorial on virtual environments for Python. Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you could be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and Material for MkDocs through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes. with docker recommended \u00b6 The official Docker image is a great way to get up and running in a few minutes, as it comes with all dependencies pre-installed. Pull the image for the latest version with: docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material The mkdocs executable is provided as an entry point and serve is the default command. Start the development server in your project root \u2013 the folder where mkdocs.yml resides \u2014 with: Unix docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material Windows docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v \"%cd%\":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material with git \u00b6 Material for MkDocs can be directly used from GitHub by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you want to use the very latest version: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . Configuration \u00b6 Depending on your installation method, you can now add the following lines to mkdocs.yml in your project root. If you installed Material for MkDocs using a package manager, add: theme : name : material If you cloned Material for MkDocs from GitHub add: theme : name : null custom_dir : mkdocs-material/material MkDocs includes a development server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The development server can be started with the following command: mkdocs serve Point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and your documentation should greet you in a new look. If you're starting from scratch, the following configuration can be used as a starting point: Example configuration This is an excerpt from the mkdocs.yml used to render these pages: # Project information site_name : Material for MkDocs site_description : A Material Design theme for MkDocs site_author : Martin Donath site_url : https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ # Repository repo_name : squidfunk/mkdocs-material repo_url : https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material # Copyright copyright : Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2020 Martin Donath # Configuration theme : name : material language : en palette : primary : indigo accent : indigo font : text : Roboto code : Roboto Mono # Extras extra : social : - icon : fontawesome/brands/github-alt link : https://github.com/squidfunk - icon : fontawesome/brands/twitter link : https://twitter.com/squidfunk - icon : fontawesome/brands/linkedin link : https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk # Google Analytics google_analytics : - UA-XXXXXXXX-X - auto # Extensions markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true Feature flags \u00b6 These optional features are hidden behind flags and can be explicitly enabled in mkdocs.yml . Instant loading \u00b6 The (still experimental) instant loading feature will intercept clicks on all internal links and dispatch them directly via XHR without a full page reload. It can be enabled from mkdocs.yml with: theme : features : - instant The resulting page is parsed and injected and all event handlers and components are automatically rebound. This means that Material for MkDocs behaves like a Single Page Application , which is especially useful for large documentation sites that come with a huge search index, as the search index will now remain intact in-between document switches. Tabs \u00b6 The tabs feature will render top-level subsections in another navigational layer below the header on big screens (but leave them untouched on mobile). It can be enabled from mkdocs.yml with: theme : features : - tabs Note that all top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml will be grouped under the first tab which will receive the title of the first page. This means that there will effectively be no collapsible subsections for the first tab, as each subsection is rendered as another tab. If you want more fine-grained control, i.e., collapsible subsections for the first tab, you can move all top-level pages into a subsection , so that the top-level is entirely made up of subsections. Note that tabs are only shown for larger screens, so make sure that navigation is plausible on mobile devices. As an example, see the mkdocs.yml used to render these pages. Language \u00b6 Default: en Material for MkDocs supports internationalization (i18n) and provides translations for all template variables and labels. You can set the language from mkdocs.yml with: theme : language : en The following language codes are supported: .md-language-list { -webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2; columns: 2; } .md-language-list li { -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; break-inside: avoid; } af / Afrikaans ar / Arabic bn / Bengali (Bangla) ca / Catalan cs / Czech da / Danish de / German en / English es / Spanish et / Estonian fa / Persian (Farsi) fi / Finnish fr / French gl / Galician gr / Greek he / Hebrew hi / Hindi hr / Croatian hu / Hungarian id / Indonesian it / Italian ja / Japanese kr / Korean my / Burmese nl / Dutch nn / Norwegian (Nynorsk) no / Norwegian pl / Polish pt / Portuguese ro / Romanian ru / Russian sh / Serbo-Croatian si / Slovenian sk / Slovak sr / Serbian sv / Swedish th / Thai tr / Turkish uk / Ukrainian vi / Vietnamese zh / Chinese (Simplified) zh-Hant / Chinese (Traditional) zh-TW / Chinese (Taiwanese) Add language While many languages are read ltr (left-to-right), Material for MkDocs also supports rtl (right-to-left) directionality which is inferred from the selected language, but can also be set with: theme : direction : rtl Color scheme \u00b6 Default: default Material for MkDocs supports two color schemes: a light mode, which is just called default , and a dark mode, which is called slate . The color scheme can be set from mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : scheme : slate Click on a color name to change the color scheme of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-scheme] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-primary-bg-color); background-color: var(--md-primary-fg-color); } default slate var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-scheme]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-scheme\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) The color scheme can also be set based on user preference , which makes use of the prefers-color-scheme media query. This can be done by adding the following to mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : scheme : preference Color palette \u00b6 The Material Design color palette comes with 20 hues, all of which are included with Material for MkDocs. Primary and accent colors can be set from the project root's mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : primary : indigo accent : indigo If the colors are set with these configuration options, an additional CSS file that includes the hues of the color palette is automatically included and linked from the template. Custom colors with CSS variables Material for MkDocs defines all colors as CSS variables. If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand's colors), you can add an additional stylesheet and override the defaults: : root { /* Default color shades */ -- md-default-fg-color : ... ; -- md-default-fg-color--light : ... ; -- md-default-fg-color--lighter : ... ; -- md-default-fg-color--lightest : ... ; -- md-default-bg-color : ... ; -- md-default-bg-color--light : ... ; -- md-default-bg-color--lighter : ... ; -- md-default-bg-color--lightest : ... ; /* Primary color shades */ -- md-primary-fg-color : ... ; -- md-primary-fg-color--light : ... ; -- md-primary-fg-color--dark : ... ; -- md-primary-bg-color : ... ; -- md-primary-bg-color--light : ... ; /* Accent color shades */ -- md-accent-fg-color : ... ; -- md-accent-fg-color--transparent : ... ; -- md-accent-bg-color : ... ; -- md-accent-bg-color--light : ... ; } : root > * { /* Code block color shades */ -- md-code-bg-color : ... ; -- md-code-fg-color : ... ; } Primary color \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a color name to change the primary color of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-primary] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-primary-bg-color); background-color: var(--md-primary-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange brown grey blue grey black white var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-primary\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) Accent color \u00b6 Default: indigo Click on a color name to change the accent color of the theme: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] { cursor: pointer; transition: opacity 250ms; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent]:hover { opacity: 0.75; } .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] > code { display: block; color: var(--md-accent-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { var attr = \"data-md-color-accent\" button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { document.body.setAttribute(attr, this.getAttribute(attr)) }) }) Fonts \u00b6 Default: Roboto and Roboto Mono The Roboto font family is the default font included with the theme, specifically the regular sans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and can be changed to any valid webfont, like for example the Ubuntu font family : theme : font : text : Ubuntu code : Ubuntu Mono The text font will be loaded in weights 400 and 700 , the monospaced font in regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use Google Fonts for data privacy reasons, just set font to false : theme : font : false Icons \u00b6 Default: material/library and fontawesome/brands/git-alt Material for MkDocs uses icons in several places. Currently, the following icons can be changed from mkdocs.yml : the logo icon, the repository icon and the social link icons . While the social link icons are tied to the respective entries, the other icons can be changed by referencing a valid path (without the trailing .svg ) relative to the .icons folder which comes with the theme: theme : icon : logo : material/library repo : fontawesome/brands/git-alt All icons are directly inlined as *.svg files, so no further requests will be made. Icon sets which are bundled with Material for MkDocs: Material Design icons ( material ): 5.1k icons FontAwesome icons ( fontawesome ): 1.6k icons GitHub's Octicons ( octicons ): 200 icons You can use all those icons directly from Markdown ! Logo \u00b6 Default: icon set through theme.icon.logo If you want to replace the icon in the header (screen) and drawer (mobile) with your brand's logo, you can place an image file in your docs folder and use the following option in mkdocs.yml : theme : logo : images/logo.svg Ideally, the image should be a square with a minimum resolution of 96x96, leave some room towards the edges and be composed of high contrast areas on a transparent ground, as it will be placed on the colored header and drawer. Favicon \u00b6 Default: assets/images/favicon.png The default favicon can be changed with: theme : favicon : images/favicon.png Extras \u00b6 Adding a source repository \u00b6 To include a link to the repository of your project within your documentation, set the following variables via your project's mkdocs.yml : repo_name : squidfunk/mkdocs-material repo_url : https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material The name of the repository will be rendered next to the search bar on big screens and as part of the main navigation drawer on smaller screen sizes. Additionally, for GitHub and GitLab, the number of stars and forks is shown. Note that the repository icon can be explicitly set through theme.icon.repo . Why is there an edit button at the top of every article? If the repo_url is set to a GitHub or BitBucket repository, and the repo_name is set to GitHub or BitBucket (implied by default), an edit button will appear at the top of every article. This is the automatic behavior that MkDocs implements. See the MkDocs documentation on more guidance regarding the edit_uri attribute, which defines whether the edit button is shown or not. Adding social links \u00b6 Social accounts can be linked in the footer of the documentation using the icons which are bundled with the theme. Note that each icon must point to a valid path (without the trailing .svg ) relative to the .icons folder which comes with the theme: extra : social : - icon : fontawesome/brands/github-alt link : https://github.com/squidfunk - icon : fontawesome/brands/twitter link : https://twitter.com/squidfunk - icon : fontawesome/brands/linkedin link : https://linkedin.com/in/squidfunk By default, the link title will be set to the domain name, e.g. github.com . If you want to set a discernable name, e.g., to improve your Lighthouse score, you can set the name attribute on each social link. Adding a Web App Manifest \u00b6 A Web App Manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. You can specify such a manifest in mkdocs.yml : extra : manifest : manifest.webmanifest Integrations \u00b6 Google Analytics \u00b6 MkDocs makes it easy to integrate site tracking with Google Analytics. To enable tracking, which is disabled by default, you must add your tracking identifier to mkdocs.yml : google_analytics : - UA-XXXXXXXX-X - auto Besides basic page views, site search can also be tracked to better understand how people use your documentation and what they expect to find. To enable search tracking: Go to your Google Analytics admin settings Select the property for the respective tracking code Go to the view settings tab. Scroll down and enable site search settings Set the query parameter to q . Disqus \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is integrated with Disqus , so if you want to add a comments section to your documentation set the shortname of your Disqus project in mkdocs.yml : extra : disqus : your-shortname The comments section is inserted on every page, except the index page . The necessary JavaScript is automatically included. Requirements Note that site_url must be set in mkdocs.yml for the Disqus integration to load properly. Disqus can also be enabled or disabled for specific pages using Metadata . Extensions \u00b6 Markdown comes with several very useful extensions, the following of which are not enabled by default but highly recommended, so enabling them should definitely be a good idea: markdown_extensions : - admonition - codehilite : guess_lang : false - toc : permalink : true See the following list of extensions supported by Material for MkDocs including some more information on configuration and usage: Admonition Codehilite Footnotes Metadata Permalinks PyMdown Extensions Plugins \u00b6 MkDocs' plugin architecture makes it possible to add pre- or post-processing steps that sit between the theme and your documentation.

Installation in a virtual environment The best way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a virtual environment . Don't know what this is or how to set it up? We recommend to start by reading a tutorial on virtual environments for Python. Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you could be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and Material for MkDocs through pip , so both packages end up in different locations.

Configuration \u00b6 Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Usage \u00b6 Admonitions follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example: !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the Admonition title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string after the type qualifier. Example: !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content \u00b6 Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks \u2013 except code blocks, because the parser from the standard Markdown library does not account for those. The PyMdown Extensions package adds an extension called SuperFences , which makes it possible to nest code blocks within other blocks, respectively Admonition blocks. Example: Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. SELECT Employees . EmployeeID , Employees . Name , Employees . Salary , Manager .

This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. Example: ??? note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. By adding a + sign directly after the start marker, blocks can be rendered open by default. Types \u00b6 Admonition supports user-defined type qualifiers which may influence the style of the inserted block. Following is a list of type qualifiers provided by Material for MkDocs, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note .

It uses Pygments during the compilation of the Markdown file to provide syntax highlighting for over 300 languages and has no JavaScript runtime dependency. Configuration \u00b6 Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite Usage \u00b6 Specifying the language \u00b6 The CodeHilite extension uses the same syntax as regular Markdown code blocks, but needs to know the language of the code block. This can be done in three different ways. via Markdown syntax recommended \u00b6 In Markdown, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language identifier directly after the opening block. Example: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result: import tensorflow as tf via Shebang \u00b6 Alternatively, if the first line of a code block contains a shebang, the language is derived from the path referenced in the shebang. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf Result: #!/usr/bin/python import tensorflow as tf via three colons \u00b6 If the first line starts with three colons followed by a language identifier, the first line is stripped. This will only work for code blocks that are indented using four spaces, not for those encapsulated in three backticks. Example: :::python import tensorflow as tf Result: import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by enabling the linenums flag in mkdocs.yml or adding linenums=1 right after the language identifier: markdown_extensions : - codehilite : linenums : true Example: ``` python linenums=\"1\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Grouping code blocks \u00b6 The Tabbed extension which is part of the PyMdown Extensions package adds support for grouping Markdown blocks with tabs. This is especially useful for documenting projects with multiple language bindings. Add the Tabbed and SuperFences extensions to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - codehilite - pymdownx.tabbed - pymdownx.superfences Add your tabbed code to your markdown file. Example: === \"Bash\" ``` bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" ``` === \"C\" ``` c #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello world!\\n\"); return 0; } ``` === \"C++\" ``` c++ #include <iostream> int main(void) { std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; return 0; } ``` === \"C#\" ``` c# using System; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello world!\"); } } ``` Result: Bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" C #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello world! \\n \" ); return 0 ; } C++ #include <iostream> int main ( void ) { std :: cout << \"Hello world!\" << std :: endl ; return 0 ; } C# using System ; class Program { static void Main ( string [] args ) { Console . WriteLine ( \"Hello world!\" ); } } Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Supported languages excerpt \u00b6 CodeHilite uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter with support for over 300 languages , so the following list of examples is just an excerpt. Bash \u00b6 #!/bin/bash for OPT in \" $@ \" do case \" $OPT \" in '-f' ) canonicalize = 1 ;; '-n' ) switchlf = \"-n\" ;; esac done # readlink -f function __readlink_f { target = \" $1 \" while test -n \" $target \" ; do filepath = \" $target \" cd ` dirname \" $filepath \" ` target = ` readlink \" $filepath \" ` done /bin/echo $switchlf ` pwd -P ` / ` basename \" $filepath \" ` } if [ ! \" $canonicalize \" ] ; then readlink $switchlf \" $@ \" else for file in \" $@ \" do case \" $file \" in -* ) ;; * ) __readlink_f \" $file \" ;; esac done fi exit $?

As the name says, it adds the ability to add inline footnotes to your documentation. Configuration \u00b6 Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - footnotes Usage \u00b6 The markup for footnotes is similar to the standard Markdown markup for links. A reference is inserted in the text, which can then be defined at any point in the document. Inserting the reference \u00b6 The footnote reference is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a caret, followed by an arbitrary label which may contain numeric identifiers [1, 2, 3, ...] or names [Granovetter et al. 1998]. The rendered references are always consecutive superscripted numbers. Example: Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Result: Lorem ipsum 1 dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 2 Inserting the content \u00b6 The footnote content is also declared with a label, which must match the label used for the footnote reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink is automatically added to the footnote reference. on a single line \u00b6 Short statements can be written on the same line. Example: [^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page on multiple lines \u00b6 Paragraphs should be written on the next line.

A compatible version is always included with the theme. Configuration \u00b6 The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with Material for MkDocs: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem : smart_enable : all - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true - pymdownx.tabbed - pymdownx.tilde Usage \u00b6 Arithmatex MathJax \u00b6 Arithmatex integrates Material for MkDocs with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This can be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime which contains the MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : \"right\" , TagIndent : \".8em\" , MultLineWidth : \"85%\" , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : \"AMS\" , }, unicode : { fonts : \"STIXGeneral,'Arial Unicode MS'\" } }, displayAlign : \"left\" , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : \"none\" }; Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML Blocks \u00b6 Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline \u00b6 Inline equations must be enclosed in $ ... $ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} BetterEm \u00b6 BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Caret \u00b6 Caret makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Critic \u00b6 Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Details \u00b6 Details adds collapsible Admonition blocks which can contain arbitrary content using the HTML5 details and summary tags. Additionally, all Admonition qualifiers can be used, e.g. note , question , warning etc.: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? Yes. Emoji \u00b6 Emoji adds the ability to insert, well, emojis! By default, Emoji uses JoyPixles' emoji under the former name EmojiOne. Recent versions of the extension lock support to an older version (2.2.7) due to JoyPixels' newer, less permissible licenses included in later releases. This restricts support to Unicode 9. To get the latest support for the current Unicode version, you can use Twemoji instead which has a much more permissible license. Simply override the default emoji index being used: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg To view all the available short names and emoji available, see Emoji's documentation on your chosen index which includes links to the files containing the short names and emoji associated with each supported index. Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with JoyPixles or Twemoji , both of which are licensed under CC BY 4.0 . When including images or CSS from either provider, please read their licenses to ensure proper attribution: EmojiOne or Twemoji . Icons \u00b6 In addition, you can embed the Material Design icons, Fontawesome icons and GitHub's Octicons directly from Markdown by using Material for MkDocs's custom emoji index . It extends the Twemoji index with new short names that access any of the included icons. To use the custom index, you need to use materialx.emoji instead of pymdownx.emoji : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg Example: * :material-account-circle: \u2013 we can use Material Design icons * :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: \u2013 we can also use FontAwesome icons * :octicons-octoface-16: \u2013 that's not all, we can also use GitHub's Octicons Result: \u2013 we can use Material Design icons \u2013 we can also use FontAwesome icons \u2013 that's not all, we can also use GitHub's Octicons InlineHilite \u00b6 InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0 ; and can be activated by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js . MagicLink \u00b6 MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses. Mark \u00b6 Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols \u00b6 SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). SuperFences \u00b6 SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. SuperFences does also allow grouping code blocks with tabs . Tabbed \u00b6 Tabbed adds support for creating tabbed groups of Markdown content. Example: === \"Fruit List\" - :apple: Apple - :banana: Banana - :kiwi: Kiwi === \"Fruit Table\" Fruit | Color --------------- | ----- :apple: Apple | Red :banana: Banana | Yellow :kiwi: Kiwi | Green Result: Fruit List Apple Banana Kiwi Fruit Table Fruit Color Apple Red Banana Yellow Kiwi Green Tasklist \u00b6 Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde \u00b6 Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text. The portion of text that should be erased must be enclosed in two tildes ~~...~~ and the extension will take care of the rest.","title":"PyMdown"},{"location":"extensions/pymdown/#pymdown-extensions","text":"PyMdown Extensions is a collection of Markdown extensions that add some great missing features to the standard Markdown library.
