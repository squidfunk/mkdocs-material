# Publishing your site

The great thing about hosting project documentation in a `git` repository is
the ability to deploy it automatically when new changes are pushed. MkDocs
makes this ridiculously simple.

## GitHub Pages

If you're already hosting your code on GitHub, [GitHub Pages] is certainly
the most convenient way to publish your project documentation. It's free of
charge and pretty easy to set up.

  [GitHub Pages]: https://pages.github.com/

### with GitHub Actions

Using [GitHub Actions] you can automate the deployment of your project
documentation. At the root of your repository, create a new GitHub Actions
workflow, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and copy and paste the following
contents:

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ``` yaml
    name: ci # (1)!
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master # (2)!
          - main
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: 3.x
          - run: pip install mkdocs-material # (3)!
          - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
    ```

    1.  You can change the name to your liking. 

    2.  At some point, GitHub renamed `master` to `main`. If your default branch
        is named `master`, you can safely remove `main`, vice versa.

    3.  This is the place to install further [MkDocs plugins] or Markdown
        extensions with `pip` to be used during the build:

        ``` sh
        pip install \
          mkdocs-material \
          mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin \
          ...
        ```

=== "Insiders"

    ``` yaml
    name: ci
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master
          - main
    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.event.repository.fork == false
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
            with:
              python-version: 3.x
          - run: pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
          - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
    env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # (1)!
    ```

    1.  Remember to set the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your
        [personal access token] when deploying [Insiders], which can be done
        using [GitHub secrets].

Now, when a new commit is pushed to either the `master` or `main` branches,
the static site is automatically built and deployed. Push your changes to see
the workflow in action.

If the GitHub Page doesn't show up after a few minutes, go to the settings of
your repository and ensure that the [publishing source branch] for your GitHub
Page is set to `gh-pages`.

Your documentation should shortly appear at `<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

  [MkDocs plugins]: https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins
  [personal access token]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
  [Insiders]: insiders/index.md
  [GitHub secrets]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
  [publishing source branch]: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site

### with MkDocs

If you prefer to deploy your project documentation manually, you can just invoke
the following command from the directory containing the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

## GitLab Pages

If you're hosting your code on GitLab, deploying to [GitLab Pages] can be done
by using the [GitLab CI] task runner. At the root of your repository, create a
task definition named `.gitlab-ci.yml` and copy and paste the following
contents:

=== "Material for MkDocs"

    ``` yaml
    image: python:latest
    pages:
      stage: deploy
      only:
        - master # (1)!
        - main
      script:
        - pip install mkdocs-material
        - mkdocs build --site-dir public
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - public
    ```

    1.  At some point, GitLab renamed `master` to `main`. If your default branch
        is named `master`, you can safely remove `main`, vice versa.

=== "Insiders"

    ``` yaml
    image: python:latest
    pages:
      stage: deploy
      only:
        - master
        - main
      script: # (1)!
        - pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git
        - mkdocs build --site-dir public
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - public
    ```

    1.  Remember to set the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your
        [personal access token] when deploying [Insiders], which can be done
        using [masked custom variables].

Now, when a new commit is pushed to `master`, the static site is automatically
built and deployed. Commit and push the file to your repository to see the
workflow in action.

Your documentation should shortly appear at `<username>.gitlab.io/<repository>`.

  [GitLab CI]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/
