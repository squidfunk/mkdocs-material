# Calling for Community Experts

We're on the lookout for individuals who are passionate about supporting our
awesome community. In return for your valuable contributions, time, and
insights, __you'll gain free access to the Insiders edition__.

## Why we need you

As our project and community continue to grow, so do the questions and needs of
our users on our discussion board. Our discussion board is a vital part of our
project, serving as a hub for our community to connect and a valuable knowledge
base to complement our documentation.

We're eager to keeping it well-maintained, organized, easy to search and address
all queries which is why we need extra hands to keep up with the demand.

That's why we're building a team of Community Experts!

## Your role

As a Community Expert, your role primarily involves active participation on
our [discussion board], where we'd expect you to be:

- Answering discussions to help users with their questions
- Providing guidance regarding implementations
- Sharing insights into customizations and workarounds

## Your benefits

  [^1]:

    with which you're contributing to the project. It cannot be transferred to
    another account. Additionally, it cannot be used for commercial purposes.

## Your time commitment

We don't require a fixed number of hours each week; instead, we ask for a
minimum of __five answered discussions per month[^2]__, which amounts to
slightly more than one per week. Your active interaction within the community is
highly valued.

To do this effectively, it's best to regularly check the discussion board to see
where you can offer help. The time you invest may vary depending on the
complexity of the topics and questions.

Upon joining, you'll receive access to the Insiders' edition for as long as you
continue to assist us. Access will be renewed every three months, allowing you
the flexibility to continue your contributions or take a break as needed.

  [^2]:
    An answered discussion is a collaborative interaction where knowledge and
    expertise are shared, resulting in resolutions or clarifications that benefit
    the user and our entire community. In essence, it embodies the spirit of
    cooperation and support within our community, highlighting the power of
    collective wisdom and the willingness to assist and uplift one another.

## Ready to get started?
