## What's coming next

> Too many ideas, too little time!

Our backlog is filled with countless ideas that we came up with or that have
been suggested by our community. We're also working to make our roadmap public.
If you have something specific in mind, and wonder whether we've considered it,
feel free to ask on our [discussion board].

  [discussion board]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions

## Frequent releases

We’re committed to quickly addressing bugs, that come up and keeping our open
issue count as low as possible. Both our community and Insiders editions are
regularly updated, ensuring you have the latest features and fixes available at
all times.

## Additional benefits

As a premium sponsors, you'll enjoy additional benefits that are not available
to our individual sponsors. When sponsoring our work on one of our [commercial
tiers] starting at [$125 a month], you'll get additional benefits that we offer
for enterprises:

- [Prioritized] bug reports to keep your projects running smoothly
- Logo placement and backlink on our site for increased visibility
- Private support via email for any questions to our maintainers

### Goals

The following section lists all funding goals. Each goal contains a list of
features prefixed with a checkmark symbol, denoting whether a feature is
:octicons-check-circle-fill-24:{ style="color: #00e676" } already available or
:octicons-check-circle-fill-24:{ style="color: var(--md-default-fg-color--lightest)" }
planned, but not yet implemented. This means that each funding goal unlocks new
features for general availability in the community edition, after sponsors have
used them for a while.
