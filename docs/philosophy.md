## Design principles

- __It's just Markdown__: Focus on the content of your documentation and create
  a professional static site in minutes. No need to know HTML,CSS or JavaScript
  – let Material for MkDocs do the heavy lifting for you.

- __Works on all devices__: Serve your documentation with confidence – the
  underlying layout automatically adapts to perfectly fit the available screen
  estate, no matter the type or size of the viewing device.

- __Made to measure__: Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and much
  more with a few lines of configuration. Material for MkDocs can be easily
  extended and provides tons of options to alter appearance and behavior.

- __Fast and lightweight__: Don't let your users wait – get incredible value
  with a small footprint, by using one of the fastest themes around with
  excellent performance, yielding great search engine rankings and happy
  users that return.

- __Accessible__: Make accessibility a priority – users can navigate your
  documentation with touch devices, keyboard, and screen readers. Semantic
  markup ensures that your documentation works for everyone.

- __Open Source__: Trust 20,000+ users – choose a mature and well-funded
  solution built with state-of-the-art Open Source technologies. Keep ownership
  of your content without fear of vendor lock-in. Licensed under MIT.
