# Author's notes

## Hi, I'm Martin ([@squidfunk][1])

I'm a freelance polyglot software engineer and entrepreneur from Cologne,
Germany with more than 13 years of experience in full-stack web development and
system programming. I'm currently working full time on an exciting new venture,
an __analytical browser engine__ called [Ginseng][2].

## Why another theme?

Some time ago I wanted to release a project to the open, but it was in need of
user documentation. I checked out the available tools and stuck with MkDocs,
because it was so simple and easy to use. However, none of the available
themes convinced me.

I wanted to build something that was usable on all screen sizes from the ground
up, something beautiful and practical at the same time. Google's Material Design
appeared to be the perfect fit and this something became Material, a Material
Design theme for MkDocs.
