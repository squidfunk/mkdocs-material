Material for MkDocs uses the [sponsorware][1] release strategy, which means that
__new features are first exclusively released to sponsors__. Read on to learn 
[how sponsorship works][2] and how you can [become a sponsor][3] to enjoy the 
latest features before everybody else.

## How sponsorship works

__Material for MkDocs is split into a community edition and a sponsor edition__.

New features will first land in the _sponsor edition_, which means that sponsors 
will have access immediately. Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly 
subscriptions. If this funding goal is hit, the feature is merged into the 
_community edition_ and released to the public to be generally available. Bugs
will be fixed in the community edition and merged back into the sponsor edition.

See the [roadmap][4] for a list of available and upcoming features of the
_sponsor edition_, and for demonstration purposes, [__the official docs built
with the sponsor edition__][5].

## How to become a sponsor

You've decided to become a sponsor? Great! You're just __three easy steps__ away
from enjoying the latest features of Material for MkDocs. Complete the following
steps and you're in:

- Visit [squidfunk's sponsor profile][6] and pick a tier that includes exclusive
  access to squidfunk's sponsorware, which is any tier above $10/month. Select
  the tier and complete the checkout.
- Within 24 hours, you will be added as a collaborator to a private GitHub 
  repository, which contains a fork of Material for MkDocs with [brand new and 
  exclusive features][7].
- Create a [personal access token][8], which allows installing the _sponsor 
  edition_ of Material for MkDocs from any destination, including other CI 
  providers like [GitLab][9] or [Bitbucket][10].

__Congratulations! :partying_face: You're now officially a sponsor and can use
the sponsor edition until you decide to cancel your monthly subscription, which 
you're free to do at any time.__

## Terms

Regardless of whether you're an individual or a company, you may use the
_sponsor edition_ exactly under the same terms as the _community edition_,
which are given by the [MIT license][12]. However, we kindly ask you to respect 
the following guidelines:

- Please __don't distribute the source code__ from the _sponsor edition_.
  You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, 
  mirror it, do whatever you want with it, as long as you're not releasing the
  source code, as this would cannibalize the sponsorware model.

- If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will not
  receive future updates of the sponsor edition. However, you may continue to
  use the latest version that's available to you for __as long as you like__.
  Just remember that __[GitHub deletes private forks][13]__.
