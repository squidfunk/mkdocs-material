# Images

While images are first-class citizens of Markdown and part of the core syntax, 
it can be difficult to work with them. Material for MkDocs makes working with 
images more comfortable, providing styles for image alignment and image
captions.

## Configuration

This configuration adds the ability to align images, add captions to images
(rendering them as figures), and mark large images for lazy-loading. Add the
following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - attr_list
  - md_in_html
```

See additional configuration options:

- [Attribute Lists]
- [Markdown in HTML]

  [Attribute Lists]: ../setup/extensions/python-markdown.md#attribute-lists
  [Markdown in HTML]: ../setup/extensions/python-markdown.md#markdown-in-html

### Lightbox

[:octicons-cpu-24: Plugin][glightbox]

If you want to add image zoom functionality to your documentation, the 
[glightbox] plugin is an excellent choice, as it integrates perfectly
with Material for MkDocs. Install it with `pip`:

```
pip install mkdocs-glightbox
```

Then, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - glightbox
```

We recommend checking out the availabe
[configuration options][glightbox options].

## Usage

### Image alignment

When [Attribute Lists] is enabled, images can be aligned by adding the
respective alignment directions via the `align` attribute, i.e. `align=left` or
`align=right`:

=== "Left"

    ``` markdown title="Image, aligned to left"
    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){ align=left }
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–){ align=left width=300 }

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    </div>

=== "Right"

    ``` markdown title="Image, aligned to right"
    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){ align=right }
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–){ align=right width=300 }

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    </div>

If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image
will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

??? question "Why is there no centered alignment?"

    The [`align`][align] attribute doesn't allow for centered alignment, which
    is why this option is not supported by Material for MkDocs.[^1] Instead,
    the [image captions] syntax can be used, as captions are optional.

  [^1]:
    You might also realize that the [`align`][align] attribute has been
    deprecated as of HTML5, so why use it anyways? The main reason is
    portability – it's still supported by all browsers and clients, and is very
    unlikely to be completely removed, as many older websites still use it. This
    ensures a consistent appearance when a Markdown file with these attributes
    is viewed outside of a website generated by Material for MkDocs.

  [image captions]: #image-captions

### Image captions

Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions,
but it's always possible to use the [Markdown in HTML] extension with literal
`figure` and `figcaption` tags:

``` html title="Image with caption"
<figure markdown>
  ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

<div class="result">
  <figure>
    <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–" width="300" />
    <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

### Image lazy-loading

Modern browsers provide [native support for lazy-loading images][lazy-loading]
through the `loading=lazy` directive, which degrades to eager-loading in
browsers without support:

``` markdown title="Image, lazy-loaded"
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ loading=lazy }
```

<div class="result" markdown>
  <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa&text=–%20Image%20–" width="300" />
</div>

### Light and dark mode

[:octicons-tag-24: 8.1.1][Light and dark mode support] ·
:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

If you added a [color palette toggle] and want to show different images for
light and dark color schemes, you can append a `#only-light` or `#only-dark`
hash fragment to the image URL:

``` markdown title="Image, different for light and dark mode"
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa#only-light)
![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/21222c/d5d7e2#only-dark)
```

<div class="result" markdown>

![Zelda light world]{ width="300" }
![Zelda dark world]{ width="300" }

</div>
