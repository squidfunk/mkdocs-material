Material for MkDocs uses the [sponsorware][1] release strategy, which means
that _new features are first exclusively released to sponsors_ as part of
__Material for MkDocs Insiders__. Read on to learn [how sponsorship works][2],
and how you can [become a sponsor][3].

## How sponsorship works

New features will first land in Material for MkDocs Insiders, which means that
_sponsors will have access immediately_. Every feature is tied to a funding
goal in monthly subscriptions. If a funding goal is hit, the features that are
tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general
availability. Bugfixes will always be released simultaneously in both editions.

See the [roadmap][4] for a list of already available and upcoming features, and
for demonstration purposes, [the official documentation][5] built with Material
for MkDocs Insiders.

## Frequently asked questions

### Compatibility

_We're running an open source project and want to make sure that users can build
the documentation without having access to Insiders. Is that still possible?_

Yes. Material for MkDocs Insiders strives to be compatible with Material for
MkDocs, so all new features are implemented as feature flags and all
improvements (e.g. search) do not require any changes to existing configuration.
This means that your users will be able to build the docs locally with the
regular version and when they push their changes to CI/CD, they will be built
with Material for MkDocs Insiders. For this reason, it's recommended to
[install Insiders][23] only in CI, as you don't want to expose your `GH_TOKEN`
to users.

  [23]: publishing-your-site.md#github-pages

### Terms

_We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a
commercial project. Can we use Material for MkDocs Insiders under the same
terms?_

Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use _Material for MkDocs
Insiders_ precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given
by the [MIT license][24]. However, we kindly ask you to respect the following
guidelines:

- Please __don't distribute the source code__ from Material for MkDocs Insiders.
  You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it,
  mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source
  code, as it would cannibalize the sponsorware strategy.

- If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will
  miss out on future updates of Material for MkDocs Insiders. However, you may
  __use the latest version__ that's available to you __as long as you like__.
  Just remember that __[GitHub deletes private forks][25]__.
