# Contributing

Material for MkDocs is an actively maintained and constantly improved project
that serves a diverse user base with varying backgrounds and needs. In order to
effectively address the needs of all our users, evaluate change requests, and
fix bugs, we maintainers need to put in a lot of work. We have devoted
significant effort to creating better templates for our issue tracker,
optimizing the processes for our users to report bugs, request features or
changes, contribute to the project, or exchange with our community.

Given the wealth of valuable knowledge contained in numerous issues and
discussions, we consider our [issue tracker] and [discussion board] to serve as
a crucial __knowledge base__ that is an important addition to our [documentation]
and brings value to both new and experienced users of Material for MkDocs.
